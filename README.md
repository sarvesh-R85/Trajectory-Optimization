# Trajectory-Optimization
Trajectory optimization on Matlab . 
In this the criteria of the project is to move the robot from one part of the room to the other part in an optimized way. 
The room also contains many obstacles and the robot has to move in the optimized way without collision.  
This Optimization was done in Matlab using fmincon.

# Trajectory-Optimization
Trajectory optimization on Matlab . In this the criteria of the project is that we have to move the robot from one part of the room to the other part in an optimized way. The room also contains many obstacles and the robot has to move in the optimized way. I have done the program in Matlab using fmincon.
